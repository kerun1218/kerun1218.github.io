## Abstract

Although intergenerational transfers of time in the form of grandparenting are substantial, little is known about their role and importance. In this paper, we calibrate an overlapping generations model extended to allow for both time and monetary transfers to the US economy. We use simulations to show that time transfers have important positive effects on labor supply and capital accumulation. We also find that subsidizing the time of the retired spent grandparenting is the most effective child care policy when time transfers are allowed, while subsidizing child care expenses is the most effective when time transfers are not. They both lead to higher levels of child care with positive effects on output and capital accumulation.

### Data
- **Time use by the work force**:  From the Michigan Time Use Survey in 1986, [[Hill and Stafford (1980)]] found that young households (depending on their education level) spend between 381 and 813 minutes per week on child care.” (Cardia and Ng, 2003, p. 445) (***原文没找到对应，只有263 and 346 minutes per week ***)

- **Downward time transfer**:  From the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in 1992, they found :
	- “42.5% of households with at least one child and grandchild transferred more than 100 hours, while 33.9% of households transferred more than $500. 
	- Excluding households who could not quantify their transfers exactly or reported zero transfer, the mean for time transfers is 1177 hours. 
	- Attributing a value of zero hours to these observations yield a reweighted mean of 459 hours, respectively. The means for the whole sample (including the ones who do not have children) is 325 hours” (Cardia and Ng, 2003, p. 435)
